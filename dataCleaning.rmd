##Libraries
```{r}
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(forcats)
```

## Load origin data
```{r}
# Load the data
cd1 <- read.csv(file = "Churn.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", 
                stringsAsFactors = T)

print("ORIGIN DATA")
summary(cd1)
```

### Clean Data
```{r}

# Edit column names so that they are all lowercase
colnames(cd1) <- map(colnames(cd1), tolower)

#Data was taken at the middle of the month so replace NA, people who have not made first payemnt
#with 0

cd1$totalcharges[is.na(cd1$totalcharges)] <- 0
  
# update all factors containing "No internet service" to be part of the "No" level
cd1[10:15] <- lapply(cd1[10:15], function(x) fct_collapse(x, No = c("No", "No internet service")) )



cd1%>%
  # update all factor containing "No phone service" to be part of the "No" level
  mutate(
    multiplelines = fct_collapse(
      multiplelines, No = c("No", "No phone service")
    )
  ) %>%
    # gather factors for payment into two levels, auto deposits and manual checks
    mutate(
      paymentmethodAuto = fct_collapse(

        auto = c("bankTransfer", "creditCard"),
        check = c("electronicCheck", "mailedCheck")
      ) 
    ) %>%
        # bin tenure into short term, mid range, and long term
        mutate(
          tenure3 = cut(
            tenure, breaks = c(-Inf, 20, 60, Inf), labels = c("shortTerm", "midTerm", "longTerm")
          )
        ) %>%
          # bin tenure into quantiles
          mutate(
            tenure4 = cut(

            )
          ) %>%
            # update senior citizen as a factor with levels "Yes" and "No"
            mutate(
              seniorcitizen = as.factor(
                sapply(

              )
            )-> cd1

#Save data to csv for use in different methodologies

```{r}
