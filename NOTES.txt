TO DO:
1.Check why we get negative BIC for regsubsets (approx -2000), but then when we run the model and do BIC we get a positive(approx 6000), is it because only some categories of each variable are used?
2.see if we can make plots to show correlation between individual variables and CHURN
4. From lowest classification error we will test model assumptions
5. LDA
6. NN
