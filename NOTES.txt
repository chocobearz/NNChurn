TO DO:
1. Check why we get negative BIC for regsubsets (approx -2000), but then when we run the model and do BIC we get a positive(approx 6000), is it because only some categories of each variable are used?
2. See if we can make plots to show correlation between individual variables and CHURN
4. From lowest classification error we will test model assumptions
5. LDA
6. NN

More to do:
1. Figure out the residuals
2. All regression? with logistic
3. LDA (I think Vicky is working on this)
4. VIF

#####
Assumptions about binary log regression
#####
• log regression does not require a linear relationship
• residuals do not have to be normally distributed
• homoskedasticity (variance is rather uniform) is not required
• response variable must be binary
• observations must be independent (no matched data or repeated measurements)
• no multicollinearity
• assumes linearity of regressors and log odds (log of the odds ratio)
• requires a large sample size such that a minimum of 10 cases with the least frequent outcomes occurs for each regressor in the model

Model selected by stepwise (stepwise uses AIC, and this model has lowest AIC of all choosen models)
contract + internetservice + tenure + paymentmethod + paperlessbilling + onlinesecurity + totalcharges + phoneservice + techsupport + monthlycharges + onlinebackup + seniorcitizen + multiplelines + dependents + deviceprotection

AIC = 5872
BIC = 6009.115
